    <p>The pig wasn't going to <b>give up</b>, so he packed his things and <i>left</i>.
        When he arrived there believe it or not the queen was <i>mesmerised</i> by his <b>polite attitude </b> and his <b>precious dress</b>.
     The pig bought this dress just for the occasion. The queen immediately thought  to adopt him and so she did. 
     <i>Finally the pig  was living the life of his dreams and lived happily ever after.</i>
