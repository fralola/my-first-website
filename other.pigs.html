    Now the pig was alone because the sheep didn't want him anymore. 
    So one night he thought “maybe I just have to be like the other pigs who play in the mud all day”. 
    Finally one day he convinced himself and … <b>SPLASH!</b> He jumped in the mud. All the other pigs were <i>suprised</i> and they immediately started to play whit him. 
    The pig was having a <u>lot of fun</u>, now he was part of the pigs.
